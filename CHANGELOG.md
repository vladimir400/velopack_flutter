# Changelog

## 0.3.0

* Added release channel support: `initializeVelopack` now accepts an optional `channel` to override the update channel
* Added per-call `channel` and `allowDowngrade` overrides to `isUpdateAvailable`, `getLatestUpdateInfo`, `checkAndDownloadUpdatesWithProgress`, `updateAndRestart`, `updateAndExit`, and `waitExitThenUpdate` for checking or pulling from a different channel (including downgrades) without re-initializing
* Added `allowDowngrade` to `initializeVelopack` to permit migrating to an older version when switching channels
* Fixed potential panic in update download by propagating errors instead of `unwrap()`
